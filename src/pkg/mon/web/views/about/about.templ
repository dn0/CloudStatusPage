					Why
				</h2>
				<p class="py-2 lg:py-4">
					The goal of this project is simple: to bring greater transparency to the operational status of major public cloud services (and potentially other SaaS platforms).
					In today&rsquo;s software-driven world, so much depends on the reliability of big cloud providers.
					While each of them offers a status page, it often paints a picture that looks perfect &mdash; perhaps a little too perfect.

					How it works
				</h2>
				<div class="py-2 lg:py-4">
					<p class="md:text-base">The monitoring system is straightforward:</p>
					<ol class="list-decimal list-inside pl-2 mt-1">
						<li><b>Monitoring Agents:</b> A simple monitoring agent is deployed in every region of each cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP).</li>
						<li><b>Periodic Probes:</b> These agents regularly run &quot;monitoring probes&quot; - small tests that interact with various managed services in each cloud region.</li>
						<li><b>Official SDKs:</b> Monitoring probes are simply calling cloud's APIs using their official SDKs.</li>
						<li><b>Regional Testing:</b> All tests are performed within the same region as the monitoring agent so that reported latencies are purely regional.</li>
						<li><b>Data Collection:</b> Results from these probes are asynchronously collected in a central database and displayed on this site.</li>
						<li><b>Continuous Analysis:</b> Collected data are constantly analyzed for potential latency issues and probe failures. If something seems off, the system generates alerts, which could escalate into incidents (once verified).</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="mt-1 lg:mt-3 md:text-base">Alert and incident severities:</p>
					<ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-2 mt-1">
						<li><b>ðŸŸ¨&nbsp;Yellow:</b> automated alerts triggered by increased latencies (can be caused by a problem within the monitoring system).</li>
						<li><b>ðŸŸ§&nbsp;Orange:</b> automated alerts triggered by probe failures (can be caused by a problem within the monitoring system).</li>
						<li><b>ðŸŸ¥&nbsp;Red:</b> confirmed incident (something is wrong in the cloud).</li>

					While it's not impossible to monitor everything all the time, this project wants to grow and is open to suggestions!
